# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# ========================================
# COURSE CORRECTION LOG
# ========================================
# 2026-01-27: EPIC 4 architecture revised
#   - OBSOLETE: Story 4.1 (Dual Canvas Setup) → archived to obsolete/
#   - OBSOLETE: Story 4.7 (Splat Overlay Adapter) → never created, removed from plan
#   - NEW: Story 4.1 (Visionary Integration) → single-canvas with depth compositing
#   - Stories renumbered: 4.8→4.7, 4.9→4.8
#   - Reason: Dual-canvas cannot share depth buffers between WebGPU/WebGL2 contexts
#   - Solution: Visionary platform provides proper occlusion via single WebGPU context
#   - Reference: sprint-change-proposal-2026-01-27.md
#
# ALL STORIES FOR EPIC 4 NOW READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
