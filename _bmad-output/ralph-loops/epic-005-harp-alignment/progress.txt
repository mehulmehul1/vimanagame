# Ralph Progress Log - EPIC-005: Harp Minigame Design Alignment
Started: 2026-01-29

## Codebase Patterns
- Project: Vimana (Three.js + WebGPU + TSL)
- Location: C:\Users\mehul\OneDrive\Desktop\Studio\PROJECTS\shadowczarengine\vimana
- Source: src/
- Harp Room: src/scenes/HarpRoom.ts
- Jelly Manager: src/entities/JellyManager.ts
- Teaching Logic: src/entities/PatientJellyManager.ts
- Audio: src/audio/HarmonyChord.ts

## Design Philosophy
"The ship teaches you, it doesn't test you."
- No failure states - only patient redemonstration
- Gentle feedback (shake, discord, highlight)
- Synchronized splash = TURN SIGNAL
- Number indicators (①, ②, ③) show sequence order
- Note-by-note mode preserved as fallback

## Current Implementation vs Design
**Current**: Note-by-note teaching (one jelly at a time)
**Design**: Phrase-first teaching (all jellies, then player responds)
**Solution**: Add phrase-first mode, keep note-by-note as fallback

## Execution Order (Dependencies)
1. harp-101: Phrase-First Teaching Mode (no dependencies) - START HERE
2. harp-102: Synchronized Splash (depends on harp-101)
3. harp-103: Phrase Response Handling (depends on harp-101)
4. harp-104: Visual Sequence Indicators (depends on harp-101)
