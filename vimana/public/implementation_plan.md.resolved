# Strategic Plan: Running Engine & Game Separately

To keep things simple, think of the **Engine** as the "Motor" and the **Game** as the "Car Body." 

## 1. How you "Run" them
Since an Engine doesn't have a "Play" button on its own (it needs a game to show what it can do), you run them using these separate commands:

### To Run the Game (The Car)
> `cd vimana` then `npm run dev`
This opens the game. It "reaches inside" the Engine folder to get the physics and graphics. 

### To Run the Editor (The Workshop)
> `cd editor` then `npm run dev`
This opens your world-builder tool. It uses the **same Engine** as the game, so what you see in the Editor is exactly what you get in the Game.

### To "Run" the Engine (The Motor State)
The Engine doesn't "run" a window. Instead, you work on its files in `packages/engine`. 
*   **The Magic:** Because they are linked, if you change a "piston" in the Engine folder, any car (Game or Editor) using that engine will instantly update while it's running!

## 2. Updated AI Instructions (Step-by-Step)

### Step A: Setup the "Main Box"
1. Update the **main** `package.json` to tell the computer we have three separate zones: Engine, Game, and Editor.

### Step B: Create the Engine Room
1. Move all the logic files from the root into `packages/engine/src`.
2. Give the Engine its own "Identity Tag" (`package.json`).

### Step C: Plug the Game into the Engine
1. Go into the `vimana` settings.
2. Tell it: "Stop looking in the root for the engine; look in the new `packages/engine` room."

### Step D: Plug the Editor into the Engine
1. Go into the `editor` settings.
2. Link it to the same `packages/engine` room.

## 3. The "Black Box" (Privacy)
When you want to upload the game online, we use a **"Build" command**. 
*   It takes your Engine code and "freezes" it into a single file that players can use but can't read. 
*   This way, your game folder stays small and your engine secrets stay safe.
