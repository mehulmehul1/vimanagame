> **TL;DR:** Visionary is an open, web-native platform built on WebGPU and ONNX Runtime. Enabling real-time rendering of diverse Gaussian Splatting variants (3DGS, MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, Neural Avatars and <span style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive; font-size: 1.2em; color: #FFD700; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;">✨**any future algorithms**✨</span>), and traditional 3d Mesh, directly in the browser. We also support post-processing using feed-forward networks.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

We have developed a powerful [Online Editor](https://visionary-laboratory.github.io/visionary/index_visionary.html) based on Visionary to help users easily manage and edit 3D scenes in one click.

## ✨ Feature


- **⚡️ Native WebGPU Powered**: Utilizes `webgpu` to achieve high-performance parallel sorting and rendering of millions of Gaussian particles.
- **🎨 Hybrid Rendering Architecture**: Automatically handles depth mixing (Depth Compositing) between Gaussian point clouds and standard Meshes, perfectly solving occlusion issues and supporting complex scene compositions.
- **📦 Universal Asset Loader**: Single interface to intelligently identify and load multiple formats:
  - **Static Gaussians**: PLY, SPLAT, KSplat, SPZ, SOG
  - **Standard Mesh Models**: GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ
  - **4DGS/Avatar/scaffold-GS**: ONNX
  - **<span style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive; font-size: 1.1em; color: #FF4500;">🔥Your own algorithom</span>**: See [Export your algorithm to ONNX](onnx-export/README.md) in detail.

## News
- We have updated a comprehensive demonstration for how to export your own customized onnx model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8C1OINxDPUoiYtDi9KKz4AmwTcuVbKX/view


## WebGPU Requirements & Known Issues

- **Browser:** A recent version of Chrome (or Chromium-based browser) with WebGPU enabled is required.
- **Recommended platform:** Windows 10/11 with a **discrete GPU** (NVIDIA / AMD) is strongly recommended for stable performance.
- **Ubuntu:** Currently **not supported**. Due to a Chrome WebGPU bug, fp16 is not properly supported on Ubuntu, which breaks our fp16 ONNX pipelines. We will enable official Ubuntu support after the upstream issue is fixed.
- **macOS:** GPU performance on most Macs is limited for heavy 3D Gaussian Splatting workloads. Unless you are using a high-end chip (e.g., M4 Max or better), we **do not recommend** macOS as the primary platform, as the viewer may run very slowly or stutter.

## 🛠️ Export your algorithm to ONNX

This project supports rendering of various 3DGS/4DGS/Avater/Custom representations. To achieve this, trained 3D representations need to be exported to the ONNX format. This project provides conversion examples for 4DGS/Dynamic Avatar/Scaffold-GS, see [export instruction](onnx-export/README.md) for details.
