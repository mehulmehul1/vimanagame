# Playtest Plan: Vimana - Music Room Prototype (Archive of Voices)

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Build Version** | Music Room Prototype v0.1 |
| **Session Dates** | TBD (Internal playtest, 30-minute sessions) |
| **Objective** | Validate harp duet mechanic, jelly creature teaching, and gentle feedback system |
| **Game Type** | Contemplative 3D exploration (no failure states) |
| **Core Philosophy** | "The ship doesn't test you. It teaches you" |

### What We're Testing

1. **Core Gameplay Loop** - Harp interaction and jelly creature teaching
2. **Tutorial Effectiveness** - How well jellies teach the ship's song without words
3. **Difficulty Perception** - Is the patient teaching too subtle or too repetitive?
4. **Emotional Resonance** - Does the experience feel contemplative and harmonious?

### What Decisions This Will Inform

- Teaching cadence (reminders too frequent/infrequent?)
- Visual feedback strength (camera shake, jelly glow)
- Audio mixing balance (discordant vs harmony)
- Progression pacing (3 sequences of 3 notes each)
- Feature prioritization for next iteration

## Participant Criteria

| Attribute | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Target** | Internal team members, other teams |
| **Experience** | All gaming backgrounds welcome |
| **Count** | Minimum 5 participants for pattern identification |
| **Age** | 18+ (internal playtest) |
| **Accessibility** | Accommodations available upon request |

### Participant Profile

We want a mix of:
- **Gamer types**: Core, casual, non-gamers
- **Audio sensitivity**: Musically trained vs non-musical
- **3D game experience**: FPS veterans vs exploration newcomers

## Playtest Type

**Selected: Internal Playtest (Focused)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Duration** | 30 minutes per session |
| **Frequency** | Weekly during prototype phase |
| **Setup** | Informal, minimal formalities |
| **Recording** | Optional screen recording with consent |

**Rationale**: Internal playtesting allows quick iteration on the core harp mechanic before external exposure. Focused on the duet teaching system specifically.

## Session Structure

### Pre-Session (5 minutes)

1. **Welcome & Context**
   - Brief game description (no spoilers)
   - "Vimana is a contemplative game about learning to harmonize with a living ship"
   - Session goals: testing the harp duet mechanic

2. **Comfort Check**
   - "Take breaks anytime"
   - "Ask questions whenever"
   - "There are no wrong answers"

3. **Instructions**
   - "Play as you normally would"
   - "Think aloud if comfortable"
   - "If you get stuck, I'll note it but may not help immediately"

4. **Consent & Setup**
   - Recording consent (if applicable)
   - Control preferences check
   - Accessibility needs

### Gameplay Session (20 minutes)

**Focus Areas** (in order of priority):
1. First impressions of the harp and jellies
2. Understanding the teaching mechanic
3. Emotional response to gentle vs punitive feedback
4. Completion of the duet (all 9 notes)

**Observation Focus:**
- Where do players look first when entering the music room?
- How long before they interact with the harp?
- Do they notice jellies emerging from the water?
- What happens on first wrong note? (surprise, frustration, confusion?)
- Do they understand the jelly is teaching them?
- Any moments of delight or frustration?

**Intervention Rules:**
- Let players struggle for up to 2 minutes before hinting
- Note when you want to help
- Only intervene for:
  - Critical bugs
  - Genuine distress
  - Session time running out

### Post-Session (5 minutes)

1. **Immediate Reactions**
   - "What was your overall impression?"
   - "What stood out most?"
   - "Would you play again?"

2. **Specific Questions**
   - Harp interaction clarity
   - Teaching effectiveness
   - Feedback perception

3. **Open Feedback**
   - "Anything else?"
   - "Questions for us?"

## Observation Guide

### What to Watch For

| Category | Signals | Record | Example |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|

## Vimana-Specific Considerations

### The "Patient Teaching" Philosophy

Vimana is designed to be non-punitive. Watch for:
- Does the player feel stupid when wrong?
- Is the jelly re-teaching perceived as helpful or annoying?
- Does the camera shake feel aggressive or gentle?

### Audio-Visual Dependency

The game relies heavily on audio and visual harmony:
- Is the discordant tone unpleasant or merely informative?
- Do players notice the jelly bioluminescence?
- Is the visual feedback (glow, ripples) sufficiently obvious?

### Contemplative Pacing

This is not an action game:
- Do players feel impatient?
- Is the 20-minute session too short or too long?
- Do they want to explore beyond the music room?

---

## Appendix: Session Script

### Facilitator Script (Pre-Session)

"Hi [Name], thanks for joining the playtest today. I'm [Your Name] from the Vimana team.

Vimana is a contemplative 3D game about learning to harmonize with a living ship. Today, we're testing the Music Room prototype - specifically the harp interaction and the jelly creature teaching system.

There are no wrong answers. We're testing the game, not you. Play as you normally would, and feel free to think aloud if you're comfortable.

The session will take about 20 minutes of gameplay, then I'll ask a few questions.

Do you have any questions before we start?

[Wait for response]

Great! Let me know when you're ready to begin."
